Authentication Mechanism:

For user authentication, the Aves Bird Watching App employs Firebase Authentication. This robust authentication system is implemented using various methods to cater to the diverse needs of users. The app supports email-password authentication, allowing users to securely create and log in to their accounts using a combination of their email address and password.

Additionally, the app enhances user convenience and security by incorporating phone authentication. This feature enables users to verify their identity by receiving a one-time code on their registered phone number, offering a swift and secure login process.

Furthermore, the Aves app incorporates email-based password recovery to ensure that users can easily regain access to their accounts in case of a forgotten password. This involves sending a secure email with instructions for resetting the password, adding an extra layer of user-friendly security to the authentication process.

By integrating Firebase Authentication in these ways, the Aves Bird Watching App ensures a robust and user-friendly experience, balancing security measures with the convenience that modern users expect. The combination of Firestore and Firebase Authentication contributes to the overall reliability and efficiency of the app, creating a seamless environment for bird enthusiasts to explore, connect, and share their avian experiences.
